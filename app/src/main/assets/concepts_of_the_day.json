In cloze tests, pay attention to the logical relationship between sentences: if it's contrast, words like 'however', 'on the other hand' fit; if adding information, 'moreover', 'in addition'; if showing result, 'therefore', 'thus'; example, 'for instance'. Choosing the right linker depends on understanding that relationship."

Don't answer with your personal assumption – answer with what the text actually states or implies, such as: 'The passage says he left because he felt unappreciated.'",
    "tip": "On comprehension questions, correct answers are either explicitly stated or can be inferred from the passage. If you can't underline or point to where an answer comes from (or paraphrase a specific part), it's likely wrong. Especially on detail questions, find the exact spot that addresses the question. This prevents falling for logical-sounding but text-unsupported choices."
